In this lab i just connectdevices to each other by using straight through and crossover cable and also fiber optic cable to each other

UTP cables:
straight through cable - for different device
crossover cable - for same device
copper cable(UTP) is shortest and cheapest one of all 3 

Fiber optic for device that have very big distance 
single mode have the longest distance 
multi mode is shorter than single mode
